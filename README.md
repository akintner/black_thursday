## Black Thursday
A business is only as smart as its data. This project builds a system able to load, parse, search, and execute business intelligence queries against the data from a typical e-commerece business. The catch, however, is that all of this project's code was written in raw Ruby: there is no database to query for records, as everything is pulled directly from CSV files and analyzed through the "sales engine" and a "sales analyst" models, which hold the BI logic.
